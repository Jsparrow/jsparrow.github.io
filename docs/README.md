# What is jSparrow?

jSparrow is a tool that refactors Java code for you, powered by the Eclipse Java compiler.

Based on a set of rules you can decide which improvements should be applied to your code base. These rules include removing code smells, introducing lambda expressions, adding proper logging, and many many more. See also our [Rules](/rules/) page for more information!

jSparrow is in active development and there are new rules released regularly. The latest changes are always linked in [The Latest New Features](#the-latest-new-features)!

When it comes to refactoring, it is always important to have a measurable result. This is why we analyzed [50+ open source projects](github/statistics.html) and [Jenkins source code](/github/jenkins-statistics.html?p=jenkins-core) with jSparrow. The results are shown in the corresponding links.

You can use jSparrow as part of your development process in the Eclipse IDE or integrate it seamlessly into your CI/CD pipeline as a Maven plugin.
