# jSparrow

jSparrow is a tool that refactors Java code for you, powered by the Eclipse Java compiler.

Based on a set of rules you can decide which improvements should be applied to your code base. These rules range from removing code smells to the introduction of lambda functionals.

One of the latest additions is the usage of the [var keyword for local variables](/rules/local-variable-type-inference.html) to minimize the boilerplate code and increase readability.

You can execute it as part of your development process as an Eclipse IDE plugin or integrate it seamlessly into your CI/CD pipeline as a Maven plugin.
