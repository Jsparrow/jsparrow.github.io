# What is jSparrow?

jSparrow is an IDE extension for refactoring Java code with a rule-based approach, powered by the Eclipse Java compiler. A jSparrow rule is a definition of many small composed refactoring steps performed by the plug-in; one rule, when selected, can by itself refactor a very specific area within your system-wide code.


Additionally jSparrow now also offers markers that will allow you live and in-depth guidance towards best practice java while you are programming.

*Refactor your Java code.*
*Improve the code quality.*
*Apply the latest Java features.*

jSparrow is in active development and there are new rules released regularly. The latest changes are always linked in the [Latest Release Notes](#latest-release-notes)!
