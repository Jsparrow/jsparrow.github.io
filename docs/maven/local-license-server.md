# Local License Server

For environments with restricted internet access that are unable to communicate with publicly available services, we provide a Local License Server.
The Local License Server is a lightweight tool that can be deployed on isolated networks and still provides the same functionality as the online server.

## Technical Requirements
  - The local license server runs as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) container. 
  However, this is not a strong requirement but it is only for facilitating the deployment process. 
  [JRE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) is the minimum requirement for running the Local License Server. 
  - Physical USB connectivity - for security reasons, the Local License Server requires a physical connection with a hardware dongle. 

In case you are unable to reach the online license server, feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@jsparrow.eu) and we will arrange a setup of the Local License Server for you.
