# Statistics of Open Source Projects

For our testing we measured open source projects on GitHub.

The following statistics show results on those projects.
The [jSparrow Eclipse Plugin](/eclipse/getting-started.html) has been used to produce the results.

This is a summary of all statistics seen below. For a summary table of the individual rules, have a look at the [Statistics Summary](/statistics/statistics-summary.html) page.
