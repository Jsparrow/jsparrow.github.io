# Statistics of Open Source Projects

For our testing we measured open source projects on GitHub.

The following statistics show results on those projects.
The [jSparrow Eclipse Plugin](/eclipse/getting-started.html) has been used to produce the results.

<h2>Summary of Statistics</h2>

This is a summary of all statistics seen below. For a summary table of the individual rules, have a look at the [Statistics Summary](/statistics/statistics-summary.html) page.

### No license required
You can *review* the refactoring on your project **without a license** by installing jSparrow to your Eclipse IDE.
Install the plug-in from Eclipse IDE: [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jsparrow)
