# Statistics of Open Source Projects

For our testing we measured open source projects on GitHub.

The following statistics show results on those projects.
The [jSparrow Eclipse Plugin](/eclipse/getting-started.html) has been used to produce the results.

<h2>Summary of Statistics</h2>

This is a summary of all statistics seen below. For a summary table of the individual rules, have a look at the [Statistics Summary](/statistics/statistics-summary.html) page. 

<StatisticsSummary />

<div style="">

## Cleanup code with plugin
To see your statistics, install jSparrow by dropping this button to your Eclipse IDE workspace:

[![Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.svg)](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=3503691 "Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client")
